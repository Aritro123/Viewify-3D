💡 Inspiration

This project is a showcase of how 3D + AR experiences can be seamlessly integrated into the modern web 🌍.

✨ On GitHub, this will render with **tables, emojis, badges, preview images, and code blocks** — looking clean and professional.  

Do you also want me to add **cool badges** (like `React`, `Vite`, `License`, etc.) at the top for extra GitHub style?
